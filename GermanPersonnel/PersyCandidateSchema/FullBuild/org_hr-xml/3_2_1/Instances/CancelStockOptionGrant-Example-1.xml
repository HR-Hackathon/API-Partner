<!--The following is an example of how a previously issued StockOptionGrant 
might be removed using the "Incremental Delete" data management approach. 
A previous issued grant might be removed upon a business event such as the 
employee's termination if the employee was not yet vested under such grant.

The "Cancel" verb would be used when there was some business calculation 
or interpretation necessary. For just a routine or simple delete with no business 
calculation required by the trading partner (no response required), the Process 
verb might be used.
