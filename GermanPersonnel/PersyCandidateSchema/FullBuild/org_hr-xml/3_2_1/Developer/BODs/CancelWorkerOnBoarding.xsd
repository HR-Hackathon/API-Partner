			<xsd:documentation> 
       CancelWorkerOnBoarding conveys an instruction to cancel a previously communicated WorkerOnBoarding instance. Cancel is not a simple delete in that cancelation may require business calculations and require prior agreement on cancelation terms. 

       WorkerOnBoarding  Defines a collection of information about a newly hired employee. Ties the person to the budgeted position for which the person was hired, communicates details about the hire offer, and an assortment of information collected during the recruiting process that is necessary or valuable to capture within a core HR system.  

       Cancel is an "Action Verb". ActionExpression(s) represent and communicate data management  
       instructions. The data entities being managed are represented as elements of the WorkerOnBoarding noun in the BOD instance. 

       The Cancel verb is used when the sender of the BOD is not the owner of the 
       data, but is sending a request for the document to be canceled.
